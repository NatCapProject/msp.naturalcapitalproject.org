<h1>Step 3: Scenarios (Alternative Futures)</h1>
<img src="img/headers/overview_sm.png" align="left"><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview and Goals</h2>
Scenarios are plausible representations of the future. Developing a set of alternative scenarios can be useful for examining how actions taken today may play out in the future. In the context of MSP, scenarios can be used to demonstrate how ecosystem service benefits will change under different management, development, restoration, or climate change alternatives and indicate the synergies and trade-offs in objectives among options. Scenarios provide an important tool for planning and designing interventions to optimize the multiple objectives identified during <a href="scoping.html"><b>Scoping</b></a>.  Scenario analysis can help uncover unintended tradeoffs or surprising win-wins that are otherwise difficult to imagine when many human activities and social, economic, and ecological objectives interact in marine systems. Scenarios are most usefully developed as part of a stakeholder-driven process that elicits storylines with key drivers affecting alternative pathways to the future (Henrichs et al. 2010).  Differences among stakeholders in their preferences for human use patterns and options for management or future climate conditions can be reflected in alternatives and then consequences for shared objectives are visualized as model outputs (<a href="analyze.html"><b>Analyze</b></a> & <a href="synthesize.html"><b>Synthesize</b></a> steps). Scenario development can be an effective learning process for stakeholders, who can use results to evaluate whether policies secure ecosystem services under uncertain futures, or to consider new policies or management strategies. Spatially explicit scenarios can be generated from models (e.g., Henrichs et al. 2010), scenario tools (see tool links below), or expert elicitation.

<ul>
<li>Alternative, spatially explicit scenarios should be distinct (see pg 5 of our <a href="http://naturalcapitalproject.org/pubs/ScenariosPrimer.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Primer</b></a> for a complete list of effective scenario characteristics), and at least 2 should be analyzed to understand potential effects of management, climate, or other global change drivers on objectives relative to baseline conditions</li>
<li>Explore our compilation of use-cases (below) to help find a scenario development tool that matches your project needs</li>
<li>Recognize that although it is a time consuming process to adequately incorporate a diverse range of stakeholder visions and values; the potential for building consensus around the ultimate plan is more likely with early participation from those who will be affected</li>

When multiple human activities are competing in space, it may be a useful to identify conflicts and compatibilities among ocean uses and across sectors.  We include this exercise in the "Scenarios" step because alternative scenarios may result in different conflicts and varying compatibilities among uses.

<ol>
<li><a href="inseam.html"><b>InSEAM</b></a> is a free online map annotation tool enabling multiple users to draw features on a base map. These drawings and annotations can be organized and downloaded as digital layers to facilitate the scenario development process.   We have found that people tend to trust data more when they participate in its compilation or collection where possible. Allowing people to get involved in ecosystem service citizen science can be an extremely useful means to collect data and develop a shared understanding of current ecosystem benefits, and how they may change over time.  InSEAM requires an Internet connection so it may not be the right tool in remote places with limited bandwidth.

<img src="img/headers/faq_sm.png" align="left"><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<b>Q: How do I get started developing scenarios for MSP?</b><br>
<i>A: Scenario development is dependent on location, partners, and objectives. Identification of goals, ecosystem-service objectives, and key human and global change drivers can occur through a stakeholder engagement process, using guidance from existing plans and reports, or a combination of approaches (McKenzie et al. 2013). Refer to our list of scenarios development tools for ways to get started on the technical work involved in translating scenarios into inputs for models in the next step--<a href="analyze.html"><b>Analyze</b></a>. For example, our Belize use-case (described below) used stakeholder engagement and a habitat risk assessment tool to draft and refine three alternative future scenarios.</i><br>

<b>Q: Can Marxan with Zones or other tools be used in conjunction with InVEST models?</b><br>
<i>A: Marxan produces zoning configurations that achieve multiple planning objectives. InVEST can use zoning maps produced by Marxan (e.g., optimal locations for different sectoral uses) to assess outcomes for people based on the future changes to ecosystem structure and function resulting from activities allowed in the zones. [ADD SENTENCE GIVING EX OF WHERE MARXAN WITH ZONES WAS USED AS AN INPUT TO INVEST—IN MAPP?] NatCap has used various scenario tools as a means to create inputs for InVEST models. For example, we applied the <a href="http://www.warrenpinnacle.com/prof/SLAMM/" target="_blank"><b>SLAMM model</b></a> (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) in the US Gulf of Mexico to produce maps showing where salt marshes migrate under different sea level rise scenarios for the year 2100. These maps were in turn used as inputs to InVEST’s coastal vulnerability and blue carbon models (see Analyze -- NOT SURE EXACTLY WHY WE LINK TO ANALYZE HERE. IS THERE A LINK OR CITATION FOR THE SLAMM-INVEST WORK?).</i><br>
KA: I THINK IT SHOULD BE COASTAL PROTECTION – WASN’T IT DONE FOR THE GALVESTON AND FREEPORT WORK?
<p><p>
<b>Q: When are my scenarios final?</b><br>
<i>A: After preliminary analyses and visualization of the consequences of scenarios for objectives, scenarios can be iteratively refined to better reflect plausible or desired alternative futures. Throughout the scenario development process, continue consulting stakeholders and local experts to ensure that your scenarios are plausible, desirable, and will help your team produce information that can answer your specific research questions (e.g., Arkema et al. 2014 in review).</i><br>

<h4>New England</h4>
During meetings with stakeholders and agencies working in the New England area, it became clear that the word "scenario" was not the preferred terminology to describe future ocean uses.  NatCap continues work in the region to help provide decision makers with scientifically valid information to use for broader marine planning efforts.  See our <a href="http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/where/newengland.html" target="_blank"><b>New England</b></a> use-case for more details.
<p></p>
<h4>Belize</h4>
<p>Scenarios reflecting three plausible futures for Belize’s coastal development in the year 2025 were developed through a succession of government-led stakeholder meetings and workshops with communities along the entire coastline. These alternative scenarios are based on maps of the current distribution of ocean and coastal activities, existing and pending government plans, and stakeholders' values and preferences. The following set of rotating images describes this stakeholder-driven process where our government partner, the Coastal Zone Management and Institute (CZMAI), mapped three zoning configurations describing the location and extent of future human uses.</p><br><br>
<ul id="folio_scroller">
<li><span>Maps of current human activities in the coastal zone were compiled by our partner, CZMAI</span><img alt="" src="img/scenarios_bz_folio_1.png" /></a></li>
<li><span>Two rounds of stakeholder consultations were held throughout the 9 coastal planning regions</span><img alt="" src="img/scenarios_bz_folio_2.png" /></a></li>
