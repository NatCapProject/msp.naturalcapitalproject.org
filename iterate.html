<h1>Iterate</h1>
<img src="img/headers/overview_sm.png" align="left"><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</h2>
Iteration can occur within each step, and over the entire process.  For example, <b><a href="scope.html">Scoping</a></b> (step 1) involves defining problem definition and identification of key partnerships and stakeholders, who often bring to the table additional insights, issues, and capacities that can be intergated throughout.  The <b><a href="data.html">Data</a></b> and <b><a href="analyze.html">Analyze</a></b> steps often involve iteration through which results from intial, coarse analyses illustrate critical gaps.  At times, communication of results to new audiences will help identify new decision questions that require new data collection, scenarios, analysis, or synthesis.
<p></p>
The following is a diagram of the approach for ecosystem service assessment proposed by Rosenthal and colleagues (2014).  Here we have adapted it for marine spatial planning. Iteration is critical within each step of the process (orange inset) and between steps (inset again) for the entire process to be effective.  We find that revisiting steps 1-3 after <b><a href="synthesize.html">Synthesize</a></b> (step 5) are the most common pathways for iteration; however, other trajectories do occur.

<li>Engage stakeholders and local experts (e.g., scientists, NGOs, member of civil society) to share preliminary results</li>

<ul>
<li>Iteration can offer valuable information even when you only have preliminary data and scenarios</li>
<li>Take advantage of this step early in the project to identify additional data needs, produce initial results to show to local contacts, and get comfortable with the mechanics of this approach and applying MSP decision-support tools</li>
