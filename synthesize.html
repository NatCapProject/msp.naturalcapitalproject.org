<h1>Step 5: Synthesize</h1>
<img src="img/headers/overview_sm.png" align="left"><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview and Goals</h2>
The overarching goal of the Synthesize step is to ensure that the outputs of your ecosystem services analysis directly inform on-the-ground planning and policies. Because decision-support tools are designed to be useful in diverse locations and contexts, raw outputs from these tools often need to be tailored to the specific issues and local objectives you identified in the scoping step.  Synthesis includes highlighting and visualizing specific outputs, converting ecosystem service outputs into metrics most relevant to stakeholders, assessing spatial variation in services and their values, and highlighting synergies and trade-offs among services and human uses of the environment. This step typically requires substantial "post-processing" of model outputs to ensure that the information is customized to meet needs of the decision-makers creating the MSP. Examples of post-processing include mapping multiple ecosystem services or human activities, producing plots or tables that compare ecosystem service production among regions, or producing maps showing percent change from an established baseline (e.g., current scenario). TRY TO LINK TO THESE EXAMPLES TO FIGS IN THE VIZ GALLERY.

<ul>
<li>There are countless possibilities for ecosystem service metrics and ways to display and synthesize outputs from the <a href="analyze.html"><b>Analyze</b></a> Step.  </li>
<li>Use simple metrics and visuals that make sense and seem to resonate with decision-makers</b></li>
<li>Co-design your metrics and graphics with local partners, experts, and planners to ensure they will be meaningful to stakeholders and decision-makers in your region (CITE MCKENZIE ET AL. 2012, RUCKELSHAUS ET AL. 2015, OTHER NON-NATCAPPER PAPERS/EXAMPLES?).</li>
<li>Keep your metrics and visuals as simple as posible (see Use Cases below)</li>
<li>Ensure that your synthesis answers the key management questions and addresses the central issues identified and agreed upon on in the Scoping Step. This is your chance to deliver on agreed-upon needs.</li>
<li>Select elements of your analysis for use in planning documents and communication materials where they are relevant.  For example, in collaboration with local partners, experts, stakeholder and decision-makers, you might select a future scenario to put forward as a preferred plan.  Link outputs and select graphics to specific actionable policies and strategies in your planning documents or legislation. The more tangible you can make the link between your analysis and the planning task at hand, the better.</li>
<li>Avoid using jargon, complex terminology, or including superfluous information that will confuse your audience.</li>
<li>Ask a colleague or friend unfamiliar with your project to review synthesis products and offer feedback</li>

<img src="img/headers/faq_sm.png" align="left"><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<b>Q: Is synthesis of ecosystem service analysis all about trade-offs and synergies?</b><br>
<i>A: No it's not.  Sometimes, simply mapping current ecosystem services is useful for decision-makers to just know more about  where services are provided – in other words, which regions within their planning area specialize in which services (E.G., ARKEMA ET AL PNAS, ARKEMA ET AL. 2013 (NCC PAPER)).  In other cases, people want to know how services are likely to change under different types of management actions, without making trade-offs explicit (Guerry et al 2012, Arkema et al. PNAS). </i><br>
<p></p>
<b>Q: Is it possible to weigh options and compare tradeoffs if results are not in the same units?</b><br>
<i>A: We make tradeoffs all the time where we know the cost of something and a physical measure of what we get for that cost. First, try to synthesize results in a way that conveys to your audience what is being gained and/or lost. Quantify it in biophysical, and possibly monetary terms and spell out what might be gained or lost through some management or policy action. After presenting this information (<a href="communicate.html"><b>Communicate</b></a> step) let the stakeholders and decision-makers decide. Monetizing outputs solely for the sake of producing results in a common currency may actually result in less informed decisions.  For example, in our work on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, planners were not interested in seeing monetary values for many of the services that we modeled together. One visual we used showed trade-offs amongst numerous services in different metrics including the dollar value of shellfish aquaculture harvest, the spatial extent of recreational kayaking, and the number of floathomes (Guerry et al. 2012).</i>
<p></p>
<b>Q: Do decision-makers always want monetary valuation of ecosystem services?</b><br>
<i>A: No. It's not always about the money. Biophysical outputs such as the area of erosion along the coastline can be just as meaningful, as can numbers of people or poor families at risk from hazards (Arkema et al.2013, raw data from) . In particular, when cultural services, such as recreation or opportunities for culturally important activities are involved, monetary valuation can be unnecessary while in other cases it provides additional useful context (eg Arkema et al In Press, Keeler et al In Press). In many cases it is preferable to report outcomes directly in terms of impacts on human health or livelihoods (Ruckelshaus et al. 2013)-something done more successfully in the academic literature than in practice (e.g., Keeler et al. 2012, Myers et al. 2013)-but something to strive for in this kind of work.</i><br>
<p></p>
<b>Q: How do I assess tradeoffs among ecosystem services?</b><br>
<i>A: Tradeoffs should be assessed with your project objectives and audience in mind. When multiple services can be represented using a common unit or currency (e.g., $, number of jobs, etc.), this unit can be summarized and compared across scenarios. In cases where outputs have different units (e.g., hectares of habitat, pounds of fish, number of visitors, etc.), something as simple as proportional arrows can be used to represent increase or decrease across scenarios and services.  See our <a href="gallery.html"><b>Gallery</b></a> for some synthesis ideas.</i><br>
<p></p>
<b>Q: Which synthesis tool(s) should I use for MSP?</b><br>
<i>A: Try synthesizing results using methods or tools that are familiar and available to your team. We have found it helpful to synthesize InVEST results using a combination of GIS (ArcGIS or QGIS) and design software like Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft PowerPoint, or LibreOffice Impress. Languages like R or Python can also be used to produce synthetic visuals by those who are comfortable working in a coding environment. Do what works for you and be creative!</i><br>
<p></p>
<b>Q: How do I begin the Synthesis Step?</b><br>
<i>A: Begin the synthesis step by going back to your scoping step and remembering what issues were most important to stakeholders and policy-makers in the reason.  Make sure you link the outputs from the InVEST models back to these issues, using additional data as necessary.  For example, if people in your region are particularly interested in the risk of coastal hazards to low income residents, consider using data from the US Census Bureau on poor families and overlaying this with outputs from the InVEST Coastal Vulnerability model to identify where coastal habitats will reduce the numbers of people at high risk to hazards (e.g., Arkema et al. 2013).</i><br>

<h4>Vancouver Island</h4>
NatCap worked with the West Coast Aquatic Management Board (WCA), a public-private partnership among government agencies and diverse local stakeholders, in its creation of spatial plans for Barkley and Clayoquot Sounds on the west coast of Vancouver Island. The NatCap/WCA team iteratively mapped and analyzed ecosystem services to understand where coastal and marine ecosystems provide what services to people and to serve as measurable metrics with which to compare potential future plans, to explore potential impacts of new activities on the ecosystem and its services, and to track ecosystem condition over time. 
<p></p>
The team explored a variety of possible visuals to synthesize information:

<h4>Belize -- EXPAND TO SEE COMMENT</h4><p>KA: GREGG, YOU ASKED FOR FEEDBACK ON THE CASE STUDY. I THINK WE SHOULD INCLUDE THE ONLINE LINK TO THE PLAN AND GIVE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF HOW THESE DIFFERENT FIGURES WERE LINKED TO POLICIES IN THE PLAN.  I CAN HELP WITH THIS IF YOU WANT AND IF THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
</p>
To inform the design of the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan for Belize, we modeled three ecosystem services and produced biophysical and economic outputs for each: 1) catch and revenue from spiny lobster, 2) land protected and avoided damages from storms, and 3) visitation and expenditures from tourism.  We assessed outcomes for these three services for the <i>Current</i>, <i>Conservation</i>, <i>Informed Management</i> and <i>Development</i> scenarios.  National results for the entire country and each of the nine planning regions were produced and synthesized.
